*"Developing a Blockchain ledger for financial transactions with counterparty financial institutions for data verification."* 


## Background 

You work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finder’s lead developer, you have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

The code enables your customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, you will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

## Evaluation Results


Review the transaction hash code associated with the validated blockchain transaction.

Once you receive the transaction’s hash code, you will navigate to the Transactions section of Ganache to review the blockchain transaction details. To confirm that you have successfully created the transaction, you will save screenshots to the README.md file of your GitHub repository for this Challenge assignment.

* The user interface of the steamlit app for 'Sender', 'Receiver' and 'Amount' inputs with 'Add Block and "Validation' buttons to activate the blockchain ledger process:

* A) 4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu. Take a screenshot of the Streamlit application page, which should detail a blockchain that consists of multiple blocks. Include the screenshot in the README.md file for your Challenge repository:

## Technologies

The software operates on python 3.9 with the installation package imports embedded with Anaconda3 installation. The application was developed in VSCode 1.69.2, using the python 3.10 language and Streamlit v1.10.0. Below are installation sites and libraries for imported tools to run the program.  The application for GUI uses Streamlit to create and run the blockchain ledger and validate it.

## Usage

This application is launched from the VSCode terminal utilizing Pandas and scikitlearn `StandardScaler` to preprocess data for categorical variables in the ML algorithm model computations. Scikit ML models are tunable by adjusting input features to find parameters that result in the best outcomes for different trading strategies and adapt to market environments. While `classification_report` illustrates the evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall.    

The program is developed in VSCode using python language **.py** file. The Python library makes it possible to utilize pandas, numpy and pathlib to build this Blockchain ledger for transaction verification. The design applies the model-fit-predict process to make a binary classification of whether a startup is successful or not.
